Large parts of build/ironclad/python25.dll are compiled from C
language source files taken from Python 2.5.4 and modified as 
follows. In most cases, types and functions have been used,
without modification, to support the operation of C extension
modules which expect to be linked to the real CPython library.
Several parts of several files are #iffed out because they're 
not currently used. The file type has had redirection macros 
inserted into every associated function, which abuse the f_fp
field in service of nearly-seamless interoperability. All 
modifications can be found by searching for IRONCLAD in the 
'stub' directory.
